# WriteTeX2

Installation method is the same as WriteTeX. The plugin will be shown under Extensions => Render => WriteTeX2. The idea of this plugin is to change a text node to an equation, and change it back if it is already an equation. You may find the Previous Extension under Extensions menu useful when using this plugin. Give it a try, and feedback how do you think about it.

Have a great day, and happy drawing!
