# WriteTeX<sup>2</sup>

Installation method is the same as WriteTeX. The extension will be shown under Extensions => Render => WriteTeX2. The idea of this extension is to change a text node to an equation, and change it back if it is already an equation. You may find the Previous Extension under Extensions menu useful when using this extension. Give it a try, and feedback how do you think about it.

BTW, I am not an active user of WriteTeX because the scope of my current job is not quite related. Feel free to make PRs to improve this extension.

Have a great day, and happy drawing!
